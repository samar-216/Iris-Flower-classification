# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project classifies iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on their petal and sepal dimensions.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the famous [Iris dataset], which contains 150 samples with 4 features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Target classes:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## 🧠 Model Used

A supervised classification algorithm is trained on the dataset using models like:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree

> Accuracy and confusion matrix are used for evaluation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
